    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This classic Spanish dish is very versatile and quick to whip up. The tortilla (or Spanish omelette) can be
        served hot or cold and is a fantastic way of using up all kinds of ingredients – simply add in any leftover
        vegetables, crumbled or grated cheese, jarred red peppers or cooked sausage. They’ll all taste great, so get
        experimenting! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g waxy potatoes</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Step 1:</em> Peel the potatoes using a speed-peeler, then carefully cut them into thin slices. Pat the
            potato slices dry with a clean tea towel.</li>
        <li><em>Step 2:</em> Peel and finely slice the onion. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a small frying pan over
            a medium heat, then add the onion and potatoes.</li>
        <li><em>Step 3:</em> Turn the heat down to low and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the onions are turning
            golden and the potato slices are cooked through. Try not to stir it too much or the potatoes will break up –
            just use a fish slice to flip them over halfway through.</li>
        <li><em>Step 4:</em> Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl, season with a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper,
            then whisk together with a fork.
        </li>
        <li><em>Step 5:</em> When the onions and potatoes are cooked, remove the pan from the heat and carefully tip
            them into the eggs. Transfer the mixture back into the frying pan and place it over a low heat. Cook for
            around 20 minutes, or until there’s almost no runny egg on top.</li>
        <li><em>Step 6:</em> Use a fish slice to slightly lift and loosen the sides of the tortilla. Carefully flip the
            pan over a dinner plate and tip out the tortilla, then slide it back into the pan and cook for another 5
            minutes, or until golden and cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
